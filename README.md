# ML-Projects-Diabetes-Prediction
This **Machine Learning project** focuses on building a **Diabetes Prediction System** that determines whether a person is diabetic or not based on medical parameters such as **Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function, and Age**. The model is developed using the **Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm with a Linear kernel**, chosen for its efficiency in handling binary classification problems. The system was trained and evaluated using standard datasets, achieving an **accuracy of 77%**. This project demonstrates the practical application of ML in **healthcare analytics**, supporting early detection and preventive medical decisions.
